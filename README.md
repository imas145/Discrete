#  Discrete
### Arbitrary-precision integer calculator

Discrete is a collection of algorithms and a GUI around the [BigInt](https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt) framework. It allows to compute integer arithmetic and integer function values to arbitrary precision. So yes, you can compute 1000! (factorial) with this. The GUI parses math input using [DDMathParser](https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser).

There is no real purpose for this project, other than I think implementing some of the algorithms was interesting and educational. Still, there's a lot of room for improvements. This could be useful for someone who specifically needs to compute integer functions, be it in number theory or theoretical computer science. Speaking of which...

*the output of this app is not guaranteed to be correct*. In most cases, it is correct, but since there is basically no tests (another area of improvement), I can't guarantee that.
